## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app is functional and provides the core features, here are some planned future enhancements:

- **Payment Integration**: Add payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle rental payments directly through the platform.

- **Search & Filter Options**: Enhance property search functionality by adding filters (e.g., price range, location, property type).

- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Allow renters to leave reviews and ratings for properties they’ve rented, providing more transparency and trust.

- **Push Notifications**: Add notifications for booking requests, approvals, and rejections, as well as reminders for upcoming rental dates.

- **Mobile App Version**: Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android to extend accessibility.


## Limitations

While the app is functional, there are a few limitations we’re aware of:

- **Limited Property Search**: Currently, the app does not have an advanced search functionality. Renters can only browse properties manually.

- **No Payment Processing**: The app does not support payment transactions between renters and property owners yet.

- **Admin Permissions**: Admins can only view properties and users but cannot edit or delete them.

- **No Mobile App**: The current version is a web app and does not yet have mobile app support.

These limitations will be addressed in future updates.
